# Saints-Play-Predictor

The deployed web app can be seen at https://saints-play-predictor.herokuapp.com/

The web app predicts whether the Saints will run or pass the ball depending on down, yards to go, field position, and the time left in the game.

A gradient boosted classifer model is being used to make the predictions. The model was made using play by play data from the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 Saint's regular season games.
